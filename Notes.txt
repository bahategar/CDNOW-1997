Goals: Understand which customer to focus on
Prediction task: 
- How much will they spend in the future
- Probability will they make another purchase in the future

Reference data:
The file CDNOW_master.txt contains the entire purchase history up to the end of June 1998 of the cohort of 23,570 individuals who made their first-ever purchase at CDNOW in the first quarter of 1997. This CDNOW dataset was first used by Fader and Hardie (2001).

Each record in this file, 69,659 in total, comprises four fields: the customer's ID, the date of the transaction, the number of CDs purchased, and the dollar value of the transaction.

See "Notes on the CDNOW Master Data Set" (http://brucehardie.com/notes/026/) for details of how the 1/10th systematic sample (http://brucehardie.com/datasets/CDNOW_sample.zip) used in many papers was created.

3 Questions we will answer:
1. Which customers have the highest spend probability in next 90-days.
2. Which customers have recently purchased but are unlikely to buy.
3. Which customers were predicted to purchase but didnt
-> We can choose someone who has high prediction spending but didnt. 

Calculate CLV using ML approach. The steps:
1. Subset a cohort, in this case is a group of customers  that all start at the same time.
2. Temporal splitting => split up by time
